Hello, thank you for downloading the server files for TNP Limitless 1!

Latest changelog can be found here: https://github.com/The-Nexus-Project/Limitless/blob/master/Changelog.md

--------------------------------------------------------

To start the server simply unzip this zipfile (which you've probably done already), then edit the 'EULA.txt' and change it from 'false' to 'true'!

When you've done that double-click the 'Start.bat" file, and now the server should boot. 
(Now port-forward and you're good to go. Google how to do it if you don't know how!)

--------------------------------------------------------

Note that if you add the server into the Multiplayer List it will display an "X" symbol, don't worry about it. You can join the server anyways! Enjoy.

--------------------------------------------------------

The server by Default has 6GB of RAM allocated, to allocate more simply just right-click the "run.bat" 'Edit' and change the numbers "6144" to anything you want, preferably 5gb or above, and then save!

1GB = 1024
2GB = 2048
3GB = 3072
4GB = 4096
5GB = 5120
6GB = 6144
8GB = 8192
12GB = 12288
16GB = 16384
